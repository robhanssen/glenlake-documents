# Failure to meet

Having an Annual Meeting is a matter of law (SC Statute 33-31-701 and our bylaws Article 2.2). Failure to have an Annual Meeting because of lack of quorum is a road to wasting a lot of money. First, new notices would be send out every 30 days ($1000 per mailing) and after six months or later, this could go in front of a judge who would order a meeting (multiple thousands of dollars in legal cost; Statute 33-31-703(a)(1) and 33-31-703(b) and (c)).
